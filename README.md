# Building an Interpreter from scratch

This is a repository from the [Essentials of Interpretation](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/essentials-of-interpretation/) class (aka _Building an Interpreter from scratch_).

As mentioned in the course description, we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the interpreter themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution.

Therefore, the source code here provides only the overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ comments with references to appropriate video lectures, show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the full working interpreter.
